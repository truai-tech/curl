## Summary

The "Add to Cart" button on the product page doesn't add the product to the cart.

## Expected Behavior

Clicking the "Add to Cart" button should add the selected product to the shopping cart and display a notification confirming the addition. The cart icon in the header should update to reflect the new item count.

## Actual Behavior

Clicking the "Add to Cart" button does nothing. The product is not added to the cart, no notification is displayed, and the cart icon remains unchanged.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Go to the product page for any product.
2.  Click the "Add to Cart" button.
3.  Observe that nothing happens.

## Impact

Customers are unable to purchase products, leading to lost sales and a negative user experience.

## Possible Cause

There may be a problem with the JavaScript code that handles the "Add to Cart" functionality, or there could be an issue with the connection to the shopping cart service.
